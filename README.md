# Welcome To My Portfolio!!!
This portfolio contains my personal football (soccer) analytical projects. I will practice the skills of Data Preparation, Exploration, and Visualization using the tools of Python/R Programming, Spreadsheets, SQL, and Tableau. I will analyze data from www.fbref.com, which is a public open source database for all stats football (soccer) to do my projects.

## Project 1
### Project Description
The first project in my portfolio is for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone. In this Capstone, we had the option of using data provided to us in the course and answer a certain problem provided for us in the course, or we could pick our own data based on our interests. As an aspiring football (soccer) analyst, I chose the latter option. In this project, I used data from www.fbref.com to provide a statistical analysis of Manchester United's 21-22 season, which was their worst season in the modern Premier League era. The goal of the project was to analyze the stats of the English Premier League 21-22 to identify the key metrics which influence success and determine the key factors which influence those metrics. Furthermore, based on my findings, I would provide recommendations to Manchester United in order to experience success in the future seasons to come. In this project, I practiced Data Preparation, Exploration, and Visualization with the tools of Spreadsheets and R Programming.
